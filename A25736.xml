            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>ONE of the Kings Meſſengers is arived with Expreſs from his Majeſty, to the Queen at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> with Letters bearing date the <hi>9th.</hi> Inſtant, from the Camp before <hi>Limrick;</hi> with an account that Lievt. General <hi>Kirk</hi> having joyned the Kings Forces from <hi>Waterford;</hi> and Lievt. General <hi>Dowglas</hi> from <hi>Athloane;</hi> Compoſing 38500 Effective Men, Marched in Three Bodys towards <hi>Limrick,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advanced within Six Miles of the Town: On the <hi>7th</hi> took a Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to attack the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Forces the next Morning; which were Encamped and had Intrenched themſelves in all the Defiles leading thereto: having firſt Plowed up the Ground, made great numbers of ſmall Forts, threw Timber and Trees acroſs, and did all that poſſibly could be done to obſtruct the paſſage of the Kings Forces: Leaving the Hedges, Gardens, and other places for Five Miles together, with Muſqueteers in the nature of an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcade; and their Horſe made ſhew as if they would make vigorous reſiſtance, and ſtood our firſt Charge, but ſoon afterwards gave way to let our Forces in, to be galled by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Muſqueteers, but ours ſo reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely puſhed on, that waithin an hour forced them in all places to give way, and make them Retreat; they being that Afternoon driven from
<pb facs="tcp:41324:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>all their Poſts they ſo much relied on, and obliged to take refuge in the Town; they having had above 400 killed in their Retreat, beſides di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them taken Priſoners; and ours perſned them to the very walls notwithſtanding the firing they made from the Cannon of the Garriſon. This Evening was ſpent in takeing the moſt advantageous Poſts about the Town, and our Pioners fell to level the great number of Trenches the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had caſt up for their defence. The next Morning the King Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Livet. General <hi>Kirck</hi> to Ford the <hi>Shannon,</hi> which he did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a Mile from the Town, with Five Regiments of Horſe and Dragoons and Three of Foot; which he did with that ſucceſs and Celerity that the Enemy believing it could not poſſibly be done: Scarce ever being fordable before, that they made no oppoſition, which had they done might have greatly Deſtreſed our Troops; who ſo ſoon as they perceived them on <hi>Clare</hi> ſide fled many of them away, tho got into a conſiderable Body quitted all their Out-Works. And Colonel <hi>Earl</hi> was ſo eager in the perſuite that he might have fell pell mell with the Eenemy into the Town but his Maj. Commanded his Retreat. And thereupon our Forces have poſſeſſed themſelves of all the advantageous Hills; and have already planted two Batteries of <hi>Demy Culverin,</hi> and fired into the Garriſon, and begin to break ground: And his Majeſty, about noon, ſent a Trumpet to fummon them to ſurrender. And 'tis ſaid, a great part of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, with ſome of the Officers, were for Capitulating; but Coll. <hi>Sarsfield,</hi> who preſides Governour, reſolutely oppoſed it making a Speech to the Garriſon, of the great Diviſions there were in <hi>England;</hi> and that 50000 <hi>French</hi> had made a deſcent, and ſaid, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> would be obliged to draw off his Army in few days, to defend the Kingdom of <hi>England;</hi> and thereupon prevailed upon them, to ſtand to their Arms, returning an Anſwer to the Summons, <hi>That as K.</hi> James <hi>had intruſted them with that Garriſon, they would recommend themſelves to the Prince of</hi> Orange <hi>by their vigorous Reſiſtance;</hi> and ſo diſmiſt the Trumpet with the ſame firing the Guns after him; but 'tis not doubted, they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Sentiment ſo ſoon as the heavy Canon comes up, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the next day, being but eight Miles behind, with divers Mortars.

            <p>The Letters farther add, That juſt at the coming away of the Expreſs, our Forces had poſſeſſed themſelves of a Neighbouring, Iſland near that Garriſon, of great Importance to us; and that they had taken <hi>Ireton Fort:</hi> and they do not in the leaſt doubt, but to be in full poſſeſſion of the whole in few days.</p>
